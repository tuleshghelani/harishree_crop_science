Our advanced formulation includes technology that enhances resistance to wash-off, maintaining effectiveness even after light rainfall or irrigation."},{question:"What is the best time of day to apply Proceed?",answer:"For optimal results, apply <strong>Proceed</strong> during early morning or late afternoon when pest activity is typically higher and environmental conditions are more favorable. Avoid application during the hottest part of the day or when rain is expected within 4-6 hours of application. This timing ensures maximum contact with target pests and allows sufficient time for the product to dry on plant surfaces."},{question:"Can Proceed be mixed with other agricultural products?",answer:"<strong>Proceed</strong> is compatible with most commonly used pesticides, fungicides, and foliar fertilizers.
