  // FAQ Data
  faqs = [
    {
      question: 'What makes Super FS different from other insecticides?',
      answer: '<strong>Super FS</strong> stands out from other insecticides due to its <strong>triple-action formula</strong> combining contact, stomach, and systemic modes of action. Unlike conventional products that offer only 10-14 days of protection, Super FS provides industry-leading <strong>25-day residual activity</strong>, even in adverse weather conditions. Its unique Fipronil 5% SC formulation penetrates plant tissues to protect new growth and control even hidden pests, making it significantly more effective than standard insecticides.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly does Super FS work against pests?',
      answer: '<strong>Super FS</strong> begins working immediately upon contact with target pests. Users typically observe visible results within <strong>4-8 hours</strong> after application, with complete control achieved within 24-48 hours. The rapid knockdown effect prevents further crop damage while the residual action provides continuous protection against reinfestation. For soil-dwelling pests, noticeable results may take 2-3 days as the product moves through the soil profile.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Super FS safe for beneficial insects like honeybees?',
      answer: 'When used according to label directions, <strong>Super FS</strong> minimizes impact on beneficial insects. We recommend applying in the <strong>evening or early morning</strong> when pollinators are less active. The product becomes rainfast within 2 hours of application and is then primarily absorbed into plant tissues, reducing exposure to beneficial insects. Always follow integrated pest management practices and avoid application during peak flowering periods when possible.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can Super FS be used in organic farming?',
      answer: '<strong>Super FS</strong> is not certified for organic farming as it contains synthetic active ingredients. However, its highly targeted action and low application rates make it an excellent choice for <strong>integrated pest management (IPM) programs</strong> where minimal chemical intervention is desired. For organic operations, we offer alternative biopesticide solutions that can be recommended by our agricultural experts.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can Super FS be mixed with other agricultural products?',
      answer: '<strong>Super FS</strong> is compatible with most commonly used pesticides, fungicides, and foliar fertilizers. However, we recommend conducting a small compatibility test before tank mixing. Do not mix with strongly alkaline products as this may reduce effectiveness. For best results, add Super FS to the spray tank first, followed by other products. Our technical support team can provide specific recommendations for your crop and pest management program.'
